Kaito is an operator that automates the AI/ML model inference or tuning workload in a Kubernetes cluster.
The target models are popular open-sourced large models such as [falcon](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae) and [phi-3](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/phi3).
Kaito has the following key differentiations compared to most of the mainstream model deployment methodologies built on top of virtual machine infrastructures:

- Manage large model files using container images. An OpenAI-compatible server is provided to perform inference calls.
- Provide preset configurations to avoid adjusting workload parameters based on GPU hardware.
- Provide support for popular open-sourced inference runtimes: [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
- Auto-provision GPU nodes based on model requirements.
- Host large model images in the public Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) if the license allows.

Using Kaito, the workflow of onboarding large AI inference models in Kubernetes is largely simplified.
