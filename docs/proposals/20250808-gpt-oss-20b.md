# Title

Add [openai/gpt-oss-20b](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b) to KAITO supported model list

## Glossary

N/A

## Summary

- Model description: GPT-OSS 20B is an open-weight large language model from OpenAI designed for strong reasoning, function-calling, and agentic workflows. See the official model card linked above and blog announcement at https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/.
- Model usage statistics: N/A
- Model license: Apache-2.0.

Samepl YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: kaito.sh/v1beta1
kind: Workspace
metadata:
  name: workspace-gpt-oss-20b
resource:
  instanceType: Standard_NV36ads_A10_v5
  labelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      apps: gpt-oss-20b
```
## Requirements
The following table describes the basic model characteristics and the resource requirements of running it.

## Runtimes

This section describes how to configure the runtime framework to support the inference calls.

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime               | HuggingFace Transformers. vLLM support will be available once v0.10.1 is released.                                     |
| Distributed Inference | False                                                                                                                  |
| Custom configurations | Kaito enables `torch_dtype=auto` and `allow_remote_files` by default to use the modelâ€™s chat template when applicable. |

Note: vLLM is not supported for gpt-oss-20b at this time.
